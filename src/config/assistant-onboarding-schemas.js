 * Per-role onboarding configurationSchema definitions, keyed by masterAssistants.roleKey.
 * Feed these straight into window.AssistantOnboardingShell.mount({ configurationSchema })
 * — the shell saves the answers to aiAssistants.onboardingContext, which the chat
 * orchestrator (netlify/functions/chat-orchestrator.ts ROUTES) injects into every
 * conversation's system prompt. Field `key`s here must therefore match the
 * onboardingValue() lookups in the orchestrator route for the same roleKey.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const schema = window.AssistantOnboardingSchemas['lead-qualifier'];
 *   if (schema) AssistantOnboardingShell.mount({ container, assistantId, configurationSchema: schema });
